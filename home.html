    <h1>Hi! My name is Haru!</h1>

    <h2>How it all started</h2>
    <p>I was rescued from the streets of South LA, where I was found barely alive. I had a horrible flea infestation and all my teeth fell out since the infection was so bad. I even had a gaping hole in my gums that went straight to my sinuses. ðŸ˜­ Luckily, someone found me and I was rescued by Saving K9 lives. Then, my mom adopted me even though I'm senior dog and was estimated to be 10 years old!</p>

    <h2>My life is great!</h2>
    <p>I cannot even tell you how great my life is. You just have to come live it. My mom makes homemade food for me. I have 8 different beds. I sunbathe every. single. day. I even have my own electric blanket. ðŸ«  My mom takes me EVERYWHERE with her (in my pouch). I L-O-V-E MY POUCH. </p>
    <p>Like I said, its hard to explain, but it's just the best life ever. You'll just have to come visit and I PROMISE that my mom will show you the best time. Shes the bestest cook too.</p>
    <p>PLEASE come visit! I am taking date requests. Please fill out this <a href="date_request.html">form</a> with your name, date, and food preference. I'll tell my mom you're coming!!!! ðŸ˜±</p>

    <h2>I cannot live without my Must Haves.</h2>
    <p>I have compiled a list for you all of my MUST HAVE items. These include my pouch, stairs, favorite beds, and sunbed. I hope you enjoy!</p>
